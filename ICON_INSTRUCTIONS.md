# Icon Resizing Instructions

To create the proper PWA icons, please resize logo.png to the following sizes:

## Required Icon Sizes:
- **icon-192.png**: 192×192 pixels (for Android Chrome)
- **icon-512.png**: 512×512 pixels (for Android Chrome, app drawer)

## How to Resize:
1. Open logo.png in your preferred image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
2. Resize the image while maintaining aspect ratio
3. Export as PNG with the names above
4. Place them in the /icons/ directory

## Alternative Online Tools:
- Use online tools like:
  - favicon.io/favicon-converter/
  - realfavicongenerator.net
  - app-manifest-generator.js.org

## Current Setup:
The manifest.json and index.html are already configured to use these icons once they are properly sized.
